# Comp140 -Street Cat Fighter
## Game
My game will be a one on one fighting game, based on the street fighter game, the camera view is side on and the player will fight an AI, the first to have an empty health bar looses, the four moves are bite, claw, block and stun, besides the health bar there is a stun bar which uses 40 out of 100 points when stun is used and slowly regains as the game plays. The main story behind the game is that the player is a cat just moved into a new town and has to fight the other cats including boss fights to gain more territory, and eventually takes the whole town.

## Controller
The controller be made of a cat cuddly toy which will have 4 buttons, the button in its right paw will make the player character claw, a button in its left paw will block all damage, a button in the toys mouth will be a bite and one button in the tale which is the stun. The buttons will have to be attached to the arduino using crocodile clips, then use insulating tap to make sure the connection doesn't come loose, the arduino will be kept in the cuddly toys tummy with a zip into it for access.
