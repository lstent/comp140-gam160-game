## Street Cat Fighter
My game will be a first person fighting game, in which the player is a cat just moved into a new town and has to fight the other cats including boss fights to gain more territory, and eventually takes the whole town.

The controller would be a lifesize cat teddy with press buttons in the paw pads, left paw is block, right paw is attack, hold the right paw button for longer for heavy attack, touch sensors on the outh for quick bite and touch sensor in the tail for stun.
All attacks apart from bite from the mouth touch sensor would have a cooldown time but bite attack leaves you vunurable to you opponent.

There could be an upgrade system in which you upgrade how much damage an attack does, how long your stun lasts for, how fast the cooldown recovers and health upgrades.

It would be possible to play against friends or random online players, but that would be something to to include in the future
